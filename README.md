# Word Help

Word Help helps you with popular games such as Scrabble or Wordscape.
To begin simply import a file named `words.txt` that contains a list of all the words in the dictionary formatted with one word per line.
Make sure you have `elixir` installed on your computer.
Then, you can run the script as simply as `elixir word_help.ex letters` and you will see a list of all possible combinations.
Optionally, you can pass a number in to get a list for only that size `elixir word_help.ex letters 4`
